# Todo

- Ability to use multiple trackers with expected features (add, delete, list)
  -[ ] Add
  -[ ] Delete
  -[ ] List

- Shell scripts to allow integration with cronjobs (for my personal use case)

- Output tracker in different data formats (CSV, JSON, TOML)

- Independant configuration for each created tracker
